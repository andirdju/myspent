          <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This application helps you take note of regular daily spending, that will usually go un-noticed. The application uses gwt and runs on google app engine and currently needs google account to access it. Check out the <a href="http://myspent.andird.org/">live version</a>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This application will not store your email address in plain format, the data will be stored in a hashed form using SHA-512.</p>

<p>The application will only store the purpose of your daily spending, and how much you spent. And No, other people cannot see your data, and even if they do, the email is hashed, so it can't be traced back to you.</p>

<p>Currently you can also found out how much you spent since sometime in the past, until now. And of course you can also remove your data so it won't be displayed or calculated in the sum.</p>

<p>The application will do all of its processing in the background. You don't even have to wait for a request to finish before making another requests. The application will update the page automatically in the background each time any of the request is completed. Or ajax in short...</p>

<h3>Chart Display</h3>

<p>Display chart for the list of spending. Chart is created using Google Chart API.</p>

<p>It will create SVG or image based chart, based on the browser support. SVG support detection is done using Modernizr javascript library </p>
